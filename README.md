# Network Flow Algorithms
In this project, we are conducting an empirical study to see which network flow algorithms are better. Our goal in this project is to see if we can figure out what kinds of graphs one Algorithm performs better than the others. We will conduct an empirical study and compare the following Network Flow Algorithms: Ford Fulkerson Algorithm, Scaling Ford Fulkerson Algorithm, and Pre flow Push Algorithm.

A flow network is a directed graph where each edge has a capacity, and each edge receives a flow. The amount of flow on the edge cannot exceed the capacity of the edge. A flow must satisfy the restriction that the amount of flow into a node equals the amount of flow out of it unless it is a source with only outgoing flow or sink, which has only incoming flow. A network can be used to model traffic in a road system, circulation with demands, fluids in pipes, currents in an electrical circuit, or anything similar in which something travels through a network of nodes.
