# NetworkFlowAlgorithms
Problem Description: I this project, we are conducting an empirical study to see which of the network flow algorithms is better than the others.
Our goal in this project is to see if we can figure out for what kinds off graphs one algorithm des better than the others. 
We will perform an empirical study and compare the following Network Flow Algorithms: Ford Fulkerson Algorithm, Scaling Ford Fulkerson Algorithm and Preflow Push Algorithm

A flow network is a directed graph where each edge has a capacity and each edge receives a flow. The amount of flow on an edge cannot exceed the capacity of the edge. A flow must satisfy the restriction that the amount of flow into a node equals the amount of flow out of it, unless it is a source, which has only outgoing flow, or sink, which has only incoming flow. A network can be used to model traffic in a road system, circulation with demands, fluids in pipes, currents in an electrical circuit, or anything similar in which something travels through a network of nodes.
